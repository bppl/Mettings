## Third Talk


In this talk, we pretend to continue where we left in talk 2 which was the beginning of the second point.

## Agenda

1. Organization, make small changes to move fast, optimize, reduce codebase, write reusable code, easy to read and documented.
2. An overview of what MVC is and how it's implemented on ByPeople.
